# README

My current research interest is fracton phases of matter, which contains type-I model (X-Cube model) and type-II model (Haah's cubic code) as exactly solvable models on lattice and multipolar tensor gauge theory as well.

I'll put some of my reading notes or outlines of my presentations on Github (if I have time). This repository 
may be updated regularly (or may be not).
